## 📖 About

Welcome to the official open-source repository for the **Q-volution Hackathon 2026**.

Girls in Quantum is a global, youth-led initiative dedicated to making quantum education accessible, especially for girls and young students. This repository mainly hosts learning resources for our participants.

Our mission is to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Participants will use **open-source SDKs** (PyQuil, MerLin, Qiskit) to solve real-world problems in energy, finance, and simulation.
