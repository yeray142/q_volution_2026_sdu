# Q-volution Hackathon 2026: Official Resources

**Hosted by Girls in Quantum**  
**Event Dates:** February 23rd – March 1st, 2026  

## 📖 About
Welcome to the official repository for the **Q-volution Hackathon 2026**. This repository hosts the technical documentation, challenge statements, starter code references, and learning resources for our global quantum computing hackathon.

Our mission is to make quantum education accessible. Participants will use open-source SDKs to solve real-world problems in energy, finance, and simulation.

## 🏆 Challenge Tracks
This year, we have partnered with leading quantum hardware and software providers to design four technical tracks.

### Track A: Energy Grid Optimization (Sponsored by Rigetti Computing)
...Details coming soon

### Track B: Quantum Machine Learning in Finance (Sponsored by Quandela)
...Details coming soon

### Track C: Algorithms & Differential Equations (Sponsored by Classiq)
...Details coming soon

### Track D: Social Impact
...Details coming soon


## 🛠️ Technical Requirements & Installation
To participate in the hackathon and run the starter notebooks, participants are encouraged to set up a Python environment with the following open-source libraries:

```bash
# General Scientific Computing
pip install numpy scipy networkx matplotlib

# Track A (Rigetti)
pip install pyquil qcs-sdk-python

# Track B (Quandela)
pip install merlin-quantum torch

# Track C (Classiq)
pip install classiq
```

## 📂 Repository Structure
Note: Details coming soon
*   `/challenges`: Detailed PDF descriptions of each track.
*   `/resources`: Curated lists of tutorials for QAOA, VQE, and QML.
*   `/datasets`: Links to the public datasets used in Track A and B.

## 🤝 Community & Support
*   **Discord:** We will post the link soon! - Join the conversation with mentors and other hackers.
