## 📖 About

Welcome to the official open-source repository for the **Q-volution Hackathon 2026**.

Girls in Quantum is a global, youth-led initiative dedicated to making quantum education accessible, especially for girls and young students. This repository mainly hosts learning resources for our participants.

Our mission is to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Participants will use **open-source SDKs** (PyQuil, MerLin, Qiskit) to solve real-world problems in energy, finance, and simulation.

## 🏆 Challenge Tracks & Stack

We have partnered with leading quantum providers to design four technical tracks.

> **Note:** Full problem statements will be released on Feb 23rd. Use the `preparation-materials/` folder to study the required libraries now.

### ⚡ Track A: Energy Grid Optimization

- **Sponsor:** [Rigetti Computing](https://www.rigetti.com/)
- **Mission:** Maximize the "Power Energy Section" (MPES) to prevent blackouts using Weighted Max-Cut problems on real-world grid data (South Carolina dataset).
- **Open Source Stack:** `PyQuil`, `NetworkX`, `SciPy`.
- **Hardware:** Top 10 teams gain access to the **84-qubit Ankaa-3** system.
- **Difficulty:** Advanced

### 💸 Track B: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in Finance

- **Sponsor:** [Quandela](https://quandela.com/)
- **Mission:** Implement a QML model using Reservoir Computing to predict put/call option prices.
- **Open Source Stack:** `MerLin` (Python), `PyTorch`.
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate (ML background preferred)

### 🧪 Track C: Algorithms & Differential Equations

- **Sponsor:** [Classiq](https://www.classiq.io/)
- **Mission:** Solve Linear Differential Equations using the Tao Xin (2020) algorithm to simulate kinetic/potential energies of a quantum harmonic oscillator.
- **Open Source Stack:** `Classiq SDK` (Python), `Jupyter`.
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate

### 🌍 Track D: Social Impact (No-Code)

- **Sponsor:** [Infleqtion](https://www.infleqtion.com/)
- **Mission:** Design a quantum solution for a social cause using Design Thinking principles.
- **Focus:** Accessible to high schoolers and beginners. No coding experience required.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- [`/preparation-materials`](./preparation-materials): **Start Here.** Study guides and reading lists for the specific algorithms (QAOA, QML, ODEs).
- `/challenges`:  Detailed PDF descriptions of each track. We're hoping to host these on Aqora!
- `/datasets`: Links to the public datasets used in Track A and B. Again, on Aqora!
