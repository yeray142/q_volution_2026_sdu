# Track C: Algorithms - Preparation Guide

**Sponsor:** Classiq

## Required Tools & Technical Requirements

**Primary Platform/SDK:**
*   **Classiq:** You will be using the Classiq platform to synthesize, optimize, and simulate your quantum circuits. 
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** Your final deliverable must be a compiled notebook containing your code, results, and graphical analyses.

## Study Resources (Recommended Reading)

To prepare for this challenge, you need to understand both the underlying theoretical algorithm and how to leverage the Classiq platform to actually build it. We have organized the resources to help you master both.

### 1. Core Theory (Read This First)
*   **Foundational Research Paper:** ["A Quantum Algorithm for Solving Linear Differential Equations: Theory and Experiment"](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.101.032307) by Tao Xin, et al. (2020).
    *   *Study Tip:* Do not just skim the math. Focus heavily on how the theoretical algorithm is structured, as your primary challenge will be translating this abstract algorithmic design into concrete circuit synthesis.

### 2. Mastering the Classiq Platform
To successfully build and optimize the algorithm, you must be comfortable with Classiq's synthesis engine. 
*   **[Getting Started with Classiq - Classiq 101](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/getting-started/):** The foundational interactive tutorials for the platform. Start here if you are new to Classiq.
*   **[Classiq Documentation](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/):** Your primary technical reference. Pay special attention to documentation regarding state preparation (like `inplace_prepare_state()`) and circuit optimization constraints.
*   **[The Classiq Library](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/explore/):** A repository containing existing implementations of algorithms and tutorials. Reviewing these will give you a massive head start on how to structure complex quantum programs syntactically.

### 3. Community & Technical Support
*   **[Classiq Community Slack:](https://short.classiq.io/join-slack)** Join the workspace! This is your direct lifeline for any highly specific technical questions regarding the SDK, circuit synthesis errors, or optimizat
