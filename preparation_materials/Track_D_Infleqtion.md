# Track D: Social Impact - Preparation Guide

**Sponsor:** Infleqtion UK

Welcome to the Quantum for Good track! Because this is a "No-Code / Design" track, there are no mandatory coding SDKs to install. 

However, **30% of your score is Conceptual Accuracy.** If you propose a quantum computer to do something a classical Macbook can already do (like running a database or a mobile app), the judges will deduct points. Quantum is not magic; it is highly specific math and physics. 

To help you build a *realistic* pitch, study these resources before you brainstorm:

**1. WHAT CAN QUANTUM COMPUTERS ACTUALLY DO?**
Quantum computers excel at two main things relevant to social impact:
*   **Combinatorial Optimization:** Solving complex logistics. Think disaster response routing, allocating medical resources during a pandemic, or optimizing traffic evacuation routes.

*   **Molecular Simulation:** Simulating nature to invent new things. Think carbon capture materials, better battery chemistry, or eco-friendly agriculture.

**2. QUANTUM SENSING**

**3. KNOW YOUR SPONSOR (INFLEQTION)**
*Pro-Tip:* Infleqtion is sponsoring this track. They are pioneers in "Neutral Atom" quantum technology and quantum RF sensors. Referencing their specific type of technology in your pitch will score you massive points in "Conceptual Accuracy."

**4. HOW TO STRUCTURE YOUR 5-SLIDE DECK**
Do not waste slides. Structure your PDF exactly like this:
*   **Slide 1: Crisis.** What is the specific real-world problem? (Use data/UN SDGs).
*   **Slide 2: Classical Bottleneck.** Why can't current classical supercomputers or sensors solve this today? (Explain the exact limitation).
*   **Slide 3: Quantum Solution.** Are you using Optimization, Simulation, or Sensing? How does it bypass the classical bottleneck?
*   **Slide 4: Social Impact.** If this works, how many lives are saved? What is the environmental metric? 
*   **Slide 5: The Roadmap.** What is required to make this real in the next 5-10 years?
